HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage using tags. Here are some key points about HTML:

Basic Structure:
An HTML document starts with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration followed by an <html> element.
Inside the <html> element, we have <head> (for metadata) and <body> (for visible content) sections.
Tags and Elements:
HTML tags represent elements on a webpage (e.g., headings, paragraphs, images).
Example:
HTML

<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>This is my first HTML page.</p>

Attributes:
Tags can have attributes (e.g., class, id, src) that provide additional information.
Example:
HTML

<img src="image.jpg" alt="My Image">

Links and Navigation:

Example:
HTML

<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Selectors:
Selectors target HTML elements to apply styles.
Example:
CSS

h1 {
    color: #007bff;
}

    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

}

JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactivity and dynamic behavior on web pages. It can manipulate HTML and CSS, handle user input, and perform various tasks. Here are some key points about JavaScript:

Event Handling:
Use JavaScript to respond to user actions (e.g., clicks, form submissions).
Example:
JavaScript

document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
});
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
DOM Manipulation:
JavaScript can modify HTML elements and their attributes.
Example:
JavaScript

document.getElementById('myElement').innerHTML = 'New Content';
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Asynchronous Operations:
JavaScript can make AJAX requests, handle timers, and work with promises.
Example:
JavaScript

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
